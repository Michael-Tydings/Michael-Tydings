- 👋 Hi, I’m @Michael-Tydings
- 👀 I’m interested in Coastal Processes, specifically sediment transportation and beaches.
- 🌱 I’m currently an undergrad researcher studying basic oceanographic concepts and delving into several research opportunities (marine sensor development and sediment transport modeling)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to geological oceanography or oceanography as a whole.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email works for me @ tydingsms@gmail.com or mst1903@uncw.edu
